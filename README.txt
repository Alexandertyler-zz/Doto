Purpose - 
	The purpose of this project is to analyze DoTA 2 replays and present
	statistics and information on the matches in a clear and informational
	format.

How to Use - 
	Right now, the program begins in a runtime loop that parses commands
	I have designated. The majority of the analysis is done through a class
	called Replay that handles initialization, local variables, and the
	majority of functions that will do data analysis.
	
	In order to make testing easy, I have been using a simple function
	called test() that does a series of calls to Replay(). This is set up to 
	only be run once per program. 

	Other commands include q to quit, h for help, and some others that
	should be ignored for now.
